Brainfresh 
Site designed to recondition children to enjoy the outside world again. 

Ar could be interesting because they interact with the real world while looking at a screen.
Look at a screen, see the real world

It starts with something engaging to a brain rot audience but as you get better and move up levels they get more relaxed. The design gets slightly more muted with each level, it also becomes slower but requires more skill. Instead of just teaching children how to do one repetitive motion, it should work on general motor skills, critical thinking and other skills necessary for development.

You start with the full 255 colour spectrum, you lose a colour after each level, you can have free play at any of the major switches e.g. 16 bit, 8bit but the earlier ones should be so easy that it's boring

Maybe an AR element where the background is the feed from your back camera and the exact number of colours you have in that level are all shown at all times, this would start by making their world more colourful but gradually the real world would become more appealing than the one on the screen. The aim of the game would be for children to want to play in the real world by the time they finish. The levels could introduce them to things they can explore further (things accessible to every child).

Level where you pop iridescent bubbles, with a bubble recipe and instructions (including diagrams)

A reading simulation level with moving pictures in the book, a narration and text coming in in real time with the narration, the game part is that you have to follow the text with your finger or the story and animation stops until you put it back ( possibly ar)

Comic book level for kids who don't like chapter books. 

Tractor simulator where you tilt the device to steer 

Bird watching

Cloud watching (draw around the shape of the cloud and then take that shape to a canvas where you can draw more.

Indoor gardening: you plant watercress and you can turn the clock or clock on the calender to jump forward

Tracing something you see in real life


Maybe a hand gesture level where you learn about makiton

The levels should cover a large range of topics so every child could find something they enjoy

Limit to a level a day using IP addresses or device id. Or whatever timeframe would
