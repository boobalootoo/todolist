Ski troop second person game (skroopers) 
You control the leader but see as a follower

If it's historical it could be something like a whiteout or that the leader has been blinded so you have to tell them what to do (should have human reaction times that decrease and accuracy increases as you practise) or it could be that you were in an accident so they're pulling you behind them. 

Or it could be futuristic where the leaders eyes got shot out but you have brain chips so they can see what you do (they have to be the leader because they are more experienced/skilled/stronger and only they can destroy the obstacles to allow everyone else through, or they have top secret info they can't tell you. If it is because of the skill the perspective character gets better over time. If it is because of secrets you can try and figure out if they are sabotaging you. If I go with the spy angle it could be that the leader was sent to retrieve someone you don't know if you can trust (possibly a prisoner) so you need to see everything they do at all times (the technology does not let you do this while also seeing what you see because of interference and it would blow your mind. It could also be a puppeting thing, where the leader is dead or in a coma so you control their movements and send them in front to clear the way for you or make sure it is safe.
